# Amazon Q Build Games Challenge
Simple game created with the help of Amazon Q as part of the AWS Build Games Challenge.

## Can you create a game idea in under an hour using Amazon Q?
Turns out ‚Äî yes, a simple game, but it's fast, fun, and surprisingly productive.

This project was created as part of the ongoing AWS Build Games Challenge (open until June 30). The challenge:
üïπ ‚ÄúBuild a retro-inspired game using Amazon Q Developer CLI.‚Äù

## The Idea
I prompted Amazon Q with the following request:

"Please create a game in JavaScript, that can run in a web browser, that uses the well-known Frogger-style crossing mechanic. But instead of a frog and cars we will be using an astronaut and aliens."

Within minutes, Amazon Q generated a functional browser-based game ‚Äî basic, pixel-style, but fully playable and built with clean JavaScript.

## Iterations with Amazon Q
From there, I made several improvements by continuing to prompt Amazon Q:

‚úÖ Implemented spritesheets for the astronaut and aliens

‚úÖ Fixed UI layout for score, timer, and lives

‚úÖ Added multiple alien types for variety

‚úÖ Integrated a background image to enhance the visual atmosphere

All sprite images and background assets were created using ChatGPT (DALL¬∑E image generation).

</p>

## The Result
A simple yet fun Frogger-style game with a space theme ‚Äî built and iterated in under an hour using Amazon Q.

## Takeaways

- Amazon Q keeps you in flow ‚Äî the back-and-forth iteration felt natural and fast.

- It‚Äôs not a silver bullet ‚Äî some programming knowledge is still necessary, especially for debugging or refining logic.

- But it is a powerful co-creator, especially for prototyping and learning.
